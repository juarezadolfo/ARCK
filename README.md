# iNFL by ARCK

The goal is to create an app (similar to a dating app but for NFL fandom!) using Node, Express & Sequelize servers. The user enters the welcome page and logs in. Then that leads to a menu including a NFL TEAM FINDER surver, API data pulls from NFL.com and more. When the user submits the survey, they are matched with a "team" that has the closest match to their personality.
